# AI Mono-Repo Project Scaffold (Turborepo)

This template is designed for creating full stack monorepos that support the development of modern, multi-agent AI applications.

The project uses **turborepo** with `pnpm` workspaces.  The backend lives in
`apps/api` while a Next.js frontend is scaffolded in `apps/web`.

A complete README is coming soon with installation & usage instructions.
